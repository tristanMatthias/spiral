## Coming together (Beige -> Purple)
Let’s look at the most basic example of this shift; Transitioning from Beige (I/Individual) to Purple (Us/Collective). How did we solve the base problem of survival in Beige? A state where all you ever think about is your own experience, and how you and the very few around you will survive another day (very “I”). We banded together into larger and larger groups of people to form tribes. Full of other people that will look out for you. You were finally safe (very “We”).

On a more personal level, we can observe this shift in babies. Born into the world completely dependant on those around them, they don’t do much until they start to interact with everyone. Here their world changes and they have to think about how their actions affect the group, and vice-verser. Their world becomes about their immediate family, barely trusting anyone outside these few people.

## “Going out” in Red (Purple -> Red)
Now solidly in Purple, we feel much safer than in Beige, and all  is well in the world. We live with this world for some time before we realise (or may never realise) that there is a whole world out there. They discover that the rain dances they were doing were not working, but the tribe down near the river had unlimited water. So they being to explore outside of Purple taking further risks and journeys each time. The entering Red becomes known for their bravery, courage, and sense of adventure. Over time they discover that they like this attention, doing more dangerous/adventurous/bigger things to impress more people around them. The tribe begins to look up to these people as a leader and protector (Red protects Purple in many ways), and thus the Chief/Warlord/Shaman/Warrior is born.

This newfound power and ego transforms the self-sacrificing Purple perspective into a self-serving Red perspective. The Red becomes less aware of the needs of the group, because they’re enamoured with the exciting, fast paced world of Red. They travel to see worlds no other Purples dared to dream of. Conquered other tribes or villages, claiming them for their own. Amassed armies of other Reds who bowed down to their strength and size.

Red cultures are very different from Purple cultures. One only needs to read the slightest of history to encounter tales depicting warlords wreaking havoc over territory disputes. They come in many variations across different cultures (Samurai, Nordic Vikings, Zulus, etc) and all represent the transition out of Purple (Us/Collective) into Red (I/Individual). Once again, the pendulum swings.
