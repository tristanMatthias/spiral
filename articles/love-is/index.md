<p style="text-align: center">
Love is family; when we’re all together.<br />
Love is the strength to stand up for that which is beautiful.<br />
Love is the sacrifice for purity and the truth.<br />
Love is boundless freedom to enjoy all that is here.<br />
Love is the path to finding peace in your heart.<br />
Love is the knowledge that all things are one.<br />
Love is.
