## What is this site?

> We explore practical applications of Spiral Dynamics & other "psycho-technologies" to improve our lives, relationships, & perspectives. [#learnspiral](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23learnspiral)

A Matter of Perspective was created to open up the discussion around practical tools to help the world and ourselves. We believe that complex problems (the meaning crisis, the race issue, global energy shortages, conscious leadership, etc.) require equally complex solutions.

To come together as a global village, we need the right tools, models, and languages for coordination and clear communication. This is something we seem to historically struggle with as a species, but it doesn't have to be this way.

The authors of this blog are big fans of practical Spiral Dynamics; however, there are *many* psycho-technologies out there to experiment with and explore. This blog attempts to focus on practical, real-life examples and applications so we can better understand ourselves and the world around us.

Join us on the journey of self-improvement, community engagement, and analysis of perspectives. We hope we can assist in some way to improve whatever it is you're doing, at whatever capacity you chose.
